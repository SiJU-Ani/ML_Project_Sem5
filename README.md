- Generates explainable AI scores with transparent breakdowns
- Reduces time-to-hire and recruitment costs

### 3. Skill Gap & Recommendation Engine
- Identifies skill adjacencies and upskilling opportunities
- Enables internal mobility analysis
- Provides workforce intelligence beyond external hiring
- Maps career pathing and skill development needs

### 4. Bias & Fairness Analyzer

- Risk mitigation and brand protection

## Architecture

The system follows a microservice architecture, acting as an intelligent layer that integrates with existing ATS platforms through:
- Direct API integrations
- Formal partnership programs
- Third-party integration platforms (iPaaS)

## Technology Stack

- **Infrastructure**: AWS (S3, EC2, SageMaker), Google Cloud AI, Azure AI
- **Data Pipeline**: Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- **NLP/ML**: Hugging Face Transformers, spaCy, PyTorch/TensorFlow
- **MLOps**: MLflow, Kubeflow, Weights & Biases
- **Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes

## Getting Started

See individual module documentation in their respective directories:
- `/modules/jd-optimization/`
- `/modules/candidate-scoring/`
- `/modules/skill-gap-analysis/`
- `/modules/bias-fairness-analyzer/`

## Strategic Advantages

1. **Integration Moat**: Best-in-class compatibility across fragmented ATS landscape
2. **Trust & Compliance Moat**: Gold standard for ethical and compliant AI in hiring
3. **Human-in-the-Loop**: Augments recruiter decisions rather than replacing them
4. **Modular Deployment**: Customers can adopt individual modules or full suite

## Target Market
