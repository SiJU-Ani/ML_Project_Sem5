# Business Model & Go-to-Market Strategy

## Executive Summary

The AI Enhancement Microservice targets mid-market companies (200-2,000 employees) with a hybrid SaaS + consumption-based pricing model, emphasizing partnership-led growth through ATS marketplace integrations.

## Target Customer Profile

### Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

**Company Size**: 200-2,000 employees  
**Hiring Volume**: 50-500 hires/year  
**Pain Points**:
- Inefficient manual resume screening
- Lack of diversity in candidate pipeline
- Risk of AI discrimination (if using basic tools)
- Limited HR technology budget
- Existing ATS investment to protect

**Decision Makers**:
- **Primary**: VP/Director of Talent Acquisition
- **Economic Buyer**: CHRO / VP HR
- **Technical Influencer**: HR Systems Administrator
- **Legal/Compliance**: General Counsel (for Bias Module)

**Budget**: $15K - $75K annually for HR tech

### Why Mid-Market?

| Market Segment | Fit | Rationale |
|----------------|-----|-----------|
| **SMB (<200)** | ❌ Low | Limited hiring volume, price-sensitive, basic ATS |
| **Mid-Market** | ✅ **IDEAL** | High pain, budget available, sophisticated but not enterprise |
| **Enterprise (2K+)** | ⚠️ Future | Often have in-house AI teams or use Eightfold/Workday |

Mid-market companies are:
- Large enough to experience screening bottlenecks
- Sophisticated enough to value AI
- Small enough that Eightfold ($100K+) is cost-prohibitive
- Hesitant to replace working ATS systems

## Pricing Model

### Hybrid SaaS + Consumption Model

**Rationale**: Align pricing with AI computational costs while providing predictable revenue.

- **Total**: $4,249/month

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) & Lifetime Value (LTV)

### CAC Calculation

## Exit Strategy / Long-Term Vision

### Potential Outcomes (5-7 year horizon)

**Option 1: Strategic Acquisition**
- **Acquirer**: Major ATS (Greenhouse, Workday, iCIMS)
- **Valuation**: 8-12x ARR (assuming $50M ARR) = **$400M-$600M**
- **Rationale**: Acquirer gets best-in-class AI capabilities

**Option 2: IPO**
- **Requirements**: $100M+ ARR, 40%+ growth, clear path to profitability
- **Timeline**: 7-10 years
- **Valuation**: 10-15x ARR = **$1B-$1.5B**

**Option 3: Independent Profitable Business**
- **Target**: $50M ARR, 30% EBITDA margin = $15M profit
- **Private equity opportunity**: 6-8x EBITDA = **$90M-$120M**

**Most Likely**: Strategic acquisition by ATS or HR Tech platform in Year 5-6
